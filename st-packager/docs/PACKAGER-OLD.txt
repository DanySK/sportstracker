SportsTracker Packaging
=======================

The project module 'st-packager' contains the Ant build script and resources
for automated creation of native application packages and native installers.
It uses the official JavaFX plugin for Ant, which is included in the JDK.

The application packages always contain the required Java Runtime Environment
(JRE), so the user does not need to install Java manually before. This also
ensures that the application always uses the proper JRE version.

Usage:
- go to the project root directory and execute the Maven build:
  $ mvn clean package
- go to the 'st-packager' directory and execute the Ant build:
  $ ant
- the created packages are located in the 'deploy' folder afterwards

Packaging has been successfully tested on:
- macOS 10.13 with JDK 10 and Ant 1.10.1
- Ubuntu Linux 16.04 (64 bit) with JDK 9 and Ant 1.10.2
- Windows 10 64 bit with JDK 10, Ant 1.10.3 and Inno Setup 5.5.9 (u)


Windows notes
-------------

Created packages:
- SportsTracker application
- SportsTracker-x.y.z.exe (with Inno Setup, optional)

- Application packages are using proper name, version and icon.
- Packages can only be created on 64 bit systems.

Native installer by using Inno Setup:
- Setup before build:
  - Download and install Inno Setup from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
  - Add Inno Setup installation path to variable PATH
- Created Installer does not ask for SportsTracker installation directory, it
  installs always to 'C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\SportsTracker'.
- The Installer creates an entry in Start menu (proper name and icon).
- The Installer EXE is much smaller than the zipped application package.


Mac OS X notes
--------------

Created packages:
- SportsTracker.app
- SportsTracker-x.y.z.dmg
- SportsTracker-x.y.z.pkg

- Application packages are using proper name, version and icon.
- The app icon must be in .icns format, conversion was done by using the web
  service http://iconverticons.com
- Mac application packages can also be created with the tool 'appbundler', but
  it is deprecated and replaced by the 'javapackager'.

Created packages:
- SportsTracker application
- sportstracker-x.y.z.deb (on Ubuntu / Debian systems)
- sportstracker-x.y.z.rpm (on RPM based systems, not tested!)

  proper name, version, icon and application categories.

  the distribution repository.
